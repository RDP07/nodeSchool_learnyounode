/* # LEARN YOU THE NODE.JS FOR MUCH WIN!  
   
 ## HELLO WORLD (Exercise 1 of 13)  
   
  Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console  
  (stdout).  
   
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
   
 ## HINTS  
   
  To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and  
  start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the  
  node command. e.g.:  
   
     $ node program.js  
   
  You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:  
   
     console.log("text")  
   
  When you are done, you must run:  
   
     $ learnyounode verify program.js  
   
  to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated,  
  and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.  */

  console.log('HELLO WORLD');
